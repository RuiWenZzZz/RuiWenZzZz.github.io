    "I work at the intersection of mathematical physics and higher category theory, with an emphasis on categorical symmetries and their applications to topological and gapless phases of matter.",
    "My research connects extended TQFT, fusion (higher) categories, and symmetry-enriched topological orders, including antilinear and generalized (non-invertible / higher-form) symmetries."
